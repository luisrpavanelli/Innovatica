Innovatica Project - React.js & Django

This is a basic login project developed in React.js, with the objective of demonstrating the implementation of a login form and the interaction with an authentication API.

#Functionalities
The users can enter the user name and show us the fields provided.
By clicking the "Login" button, the data will be sent to the authentication API.
If the credentials are valid, an access token is returned by the API and stored locally.
The user is redirected to the product list page after the login just happened.

#Used technology
React.js: An open source JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
Axios: A library for making HTTP requests to an API.
CSS: Used to style the elements and the appearance of the login form.

#Configuration
Clone or repository to your local machine.
Install the dependencies of the project using the npm install command.
Start the development server with the npm start command.
Access the application in your browser by going to http://localhost:3000.

#Observations
Make sure to correctly configure the authentication API URL in the services/api.js file.
This project is just a basic example and does not implement the full functionality of authentication and crack protection.
Feel free to explore and customize the project according to your needs.

# Innovatica Project - React.js & Django

This is a basic login project developed in React.js, aiming to demonstrate the implementation of a login form and interaction with an authentication API.

## Features

- Users can enter their username and password in the provided fields.
- Upon clicking the "Login" button, the data is sent to the authentication API.
- If the credentials are valid, an access token is returned by the API and stored locally.
- The user is redirected to the product listing page after a successful login.

## Technologies Used

- React.js: An open-source JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- Axios: A library used for making HTTP requests to an API.
- CSS: Used to style the elements and appearance of the login form.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install project dependencies using the command `npm install`.
3. Start the development server with the command `npm start`.
4. Access the application in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Notes

- Make sure to properly configure the URL of the authentication API in the `services/api.js` file.
- This project is just a basic example and does not fully implement authentication functionality or route protection.
- Feel free to explore and customize the project according to your needs.

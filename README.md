Clear! Here is an example description for the README.md file of your project:

# Login project - React.js - Django

This is a basic login project developed in React.js, with the objective of demonstrating the implementation of a login form and the interaction with an authentication API.

## Features

- The users can enter the user name and show us the fields provided.
- By clicking the "Login" button, the data is sent to the authentication API.
- If the credentials are valid, an access token is returned by the API and stored locally.
- The user is redirected to the product list page after the login just happened.

## Used technology

- React.js: An open source JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- Axios: A library to make HTTP requests to an API.
- CSS: Used to style the elements and the appearance of the login form.

## Configuration

1. Clone or repository to your local machine.
2. Install the dependencies of the project using the `npm install` command.
3. Start the development server with the `npm start` command.
4. Access the application in your browser by clicking on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Observations

- Make sure to correctly configure the URL of the authentication API in the `services/api.js` file.
- This project is just a basic example and does not implement the full functionality of authentication and crack protection.
- Feel free to explore and customize the project according to your needs.
